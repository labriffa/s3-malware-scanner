* A lambda trigger is applied to any S3 Post/Put that gets added to a specified bucket
* A lambda function is used to query the VirusTotal API and retrieve a scan URL
* The scan URL is added to an SQS scan queue to query the results of this scan at a later interval
* The SQS scan queue triggers a lambda function that queries VirusTotal to gather the resulting scan report
* Any suspicious files are added to an SQS quarantine queue for future deletion
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your AWS account.

## Cloning
The build process of the application makes use of the [AWS CodeBuild Docker Image Repository](https://github.com/aws/aws-codebuild-docker-images). This has been added as a submodule to the project's main repository. To automatically initialize and update each submodule in the repository, run the follwing command:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/labriffa/s3-malware-scanner.git
```

### Lambda Functions
S3 Malware Scanner works off a number of lambda functions that are available in the build directory of the application, the lambda function zips should respectively be added to a bucket specified by the **S3MalwareLambdaBucketNameParameter** upon  creation of the CloudFormation stack. 

### Deployment via CloudFormation
```
aws --region ${AWS_REGION} cloudformation create-stack --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --stack-name s3-malware-scanner-stack --template-body file://initialize.json --parameters ParameterKey=S3MalwareUploadBucketNameParameter,ParameterValue=${SOURCE_BUCKET_NAME} ParameterKey=S3MalwareLambdaBucketNameParameter,ParameterValue=${LAMBDA_BUCKET_NAME} ParameterKey=TotalVirusApiKeyParameter,ParameterValue=${TOTALVIRUS_API_KEY}
```
