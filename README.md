# s3-malware-scanner
Uses VirusTotal to scan S3 files as they get populated into buckets

## Basic Workflow
* A lambda trigger is applied to any S3 Post/Put that gets added to a specified bucket
* A lambda function is used to query the VirusTotal API and retrieve a scan URL
* This scan URL is added to an SQS scan queue to query the results of this scan at a later interval
* A lambda function polls the SQS scan queue and queries VirusTotal to gather the resulting scan report
* Any suspicious files are added to an SQS quarantine queue for future deletion
* A lambda function polls the SQS quarantine queue to delete any suspicious files
